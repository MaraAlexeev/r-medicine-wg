## Minutes

**Organizational**

* How do we fit with R/Pharma?  What are conference specific responsibilities versus non-conference responsibilities?
   + R/Pharma historically has been pre-clinical thru phase I vs R/Medicine includes later phases and other study designs
   
* Where do epidemiologists fit?  There is some potential for growth here, too.
   
* Do we create an over-arching structure that includes R/Pharma and R/Medicine?  There could be a lot of synergy and workshops that could be useful for both audiences.  
   + FDA submissions of interest to both
   + Many workshops of shared interest
   + Start with comparing notes (after R/Pharma conference is over)

* Potential ideas for R/Medicine
   + R/Medicine conference
   + Quarterly/monthly workshops
   + packages with ROpenSci
   + Education of med students, residents, etc
   + Durable educational materials
   + finances/grants
   + CME

* Project management support 
   + financially not feasible
   + administrative support is limited with R Consortium/Linux Foundation, but probably want someone associated with R Consortium for general support
   + CME - support typically is from a specific institution (CHOP, Michigan) so maybe we can hire some support from one of these institutions.  Peter and Stephan will get price estimates for CME.  
   
* Shiny workshop 
  + 100 signed up, 40-50 showed up
  + Mix of backgrounds
  + Procogia - teacher + 2 TAs, good presentations
  + Favorable post conference review, instructors & attendees seemed to enjoy
  
* Workshops
  + working on something with RedCap
  + if you must use Excel, how to do so responsibly.  This is a best-practices with excel paper:  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989

  
* Communication 
  + need something other than Twitter to inform people of activities
  
* Conference
  + For students, should there be a scholarship/award?  Best package - get conference registration and a small award?
  + Viewed Mara's bookdown for conference planning.  Host on the r-medicine-wg git site?
